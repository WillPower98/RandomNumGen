# RandomNumberGenerator

To execute: have Java 1.8 installed and double click the executable jar "BallyCodingTest". 
To check out the code, open up the "RandomNumberGen" in desired IDE or formatter.

Assumptions:
1) Random number is between 0 and 1. If a desired number range is desired, then the numbers can get multiplied.
2) Runtime is O(3*n + c) with the constant c being the operation to write the numbers to file. To shorten runtime, some data structure could be substituted for the present text file.
3) The user machine might not have a JVM. So some type of network protocol might have to get created to solve this. This might include HTTP with a REST API on the java end.
